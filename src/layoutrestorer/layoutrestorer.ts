     * #### Notes
     * The lifecycle for state and layout restoration is subtle. This promise
     * is intended to equal the JupyterLab application `started` notifier.
     * The sequence of events is as follows:
     *
     * 1. The layout restorer plugin is instantiated.
     *
     * 2. Other plugins that care about state and layout restoration require
     *    the layout restorer as a dependency.
     *
     * 3. As each load-time plugin initializes (which happens before the lab
     *    application has `started`), it instructs the layout restorer whether
     *    the restorer ought to `await` its state restoration.
     *
     * 4. After all the load-time plugins have finished initializing, the lab
     *    application `started` promise will resolve. This is the `first`
     *    promise that the layout restorer waits for. By this point, all of the
     *    plugins that care about layout restoration will have instructed the
     *    layout restorer to `await` their restoration.
     *
     * 5. Each plugin will then proceed to restore its state and reinstantiate
     *    whichever widgets it wants to restore.
     *
     * 6. As each plugin finishes restoring, it resolves the promise that it
     *    instructed the layout restorer to `await` (in step 3).
     *
     * 7. After all of the promises that the restorer is awaiting have resolved,
     *    the restorer then proceeds to reconstruct the saved layout.
     *
     * Of particular note are steps 5 and 6: since state restoration of plugins
     * is accomplished by executing commands, the command that is used to
     * restore the state of each plugin must return a promise that only resolves
     * when the widget has been created and added to the plugin's instance
     * tracker.
